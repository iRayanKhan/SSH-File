# SSH-File
> Used for linux based operating systems, to enable ssh without needing to connect a display to your device (usually a Pi)

# Usage:
For the Raspian OS, SSH is disabled by default. If you are unable to connect to a display and need SSH, drag this file to root (boot) of your SD card. 

# Issues:
The issues tab is here for the heck of it, there really shouldn't be any issues, unless they remove this method of enabling ssh. If so, make an issue.
